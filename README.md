Ozone Bionic Hand V1.0
The Ozone Bionic Hand V1.0 is an affordable, open-source, and highly functional prosthetic limb designed to improve mobility for individuals with limb loss. Our mission is to make advanced prosthetic technology accessible to all, especially in underserved communities in Africa. By utilizing 3D printing and off-the-shelf components, the Ozone Bionic Hand is cost-effective and customizable.

Key Features
Low Cost: The Ozone Bionic Hand costs under $300 to fabricate, making it accessible to a wider audience.
Lightweight Design: Weighing less than 600g, the hand is comfortable and easy to wear for extended periods.
Customizable: The prosthetic is based on parametric models, allowing personalization to suit individual users' needs.
Open Source: All design files, software, and guides are freely available for use and modification.
